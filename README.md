# Frozen Lake RL Agent: Monte Carlo & SARSA

This repository contains a reinforcement learning project focused on training agents to solve the Frozen Lake environment using Monte Carlo and SARSA algorithms. The project demonstrates how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to solve sequential decision-making problems in a simulated grid world.

---

## Overview

The Frozen Lake environment is a standard benchmark problem in reinforcement learning, where an agent must navigate a grid world to reach a goal while avoiding holes. This project implements two popular reinforcement learning algorithms:

1. **Monte Carlo Method**: Learns from complete episodes and uses averaged rewards for policy updates.
2. **SARSA Algorithm**: An on-policy temporal-difference learning method for estimating Q-values.

---

## Features

- Implementation of **Monte Carlo** and **SARSA** methods.
- Step-by-step documentation for understanding the learning process.
- Visualization of rewards and convergence trends for both methods.
- Well-structured Python code and Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.
